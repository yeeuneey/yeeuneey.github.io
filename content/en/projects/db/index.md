This library seat reservation system addresses the exam-period habit of reserving seats without actually using them. To alleviate the wasted space and inconvenience to other students, the platform manages user details, seat availability, reservations, and usage history in a structured way. A key feature is the complaint system: users can report issues such as prolonged absence, warnings accumulate, and repeat offenders receive temporary bans to keep the environment fair.

Starting with requirements analysis, I defined the core entities—student, seat, reservation, complaint, restriction—and clarified their relationships through conceptual and logical design using ER diagrams. From there I produced table creation scripts, populated the database with sample student and seat data, and built a working system that mirrors real operations. The project reinforced database design principles and sharpened practical problem-solving skills.
