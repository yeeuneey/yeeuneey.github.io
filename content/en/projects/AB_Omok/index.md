To improve upon the original random-move AI, I implemented an alpha-beta pruning search that results in a more strategic opponent. The evaluation function analyzes every line on the Gomoku board to score the current position, prioritizing defensive play by giving heavier weight to the opponentâ€™s threats.

To cut search time and boost performance, the algorithm only expands meaningful candidate moves near existing stones. A fallback routine starts from the center when a timeout occurs, improving resilience. These changes transform the AI from a purely random player into one that plans ahead, balances offense and defense, and responds intelligently to the game state.
