Hello! I'm Ye-eun Kim, a third-year student in the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University. I aspire to become a next-generation developer who drives innovation in the financial IT sector, grounded in a deep passion and knowledge of cloud computing, web development, artificial intelligence, and security technologies. I enjoy learning and applying new technologies, and I find great fulfillment in the process of solving complex problems.

As a planning team member of the department's student council, I have planned and managed events of various scales, strengthening my collaboration and communication skills. In the department's WHO club, which focuses on study activities for server implementation and app development, I keep up with the latest technology trends while sharpening my practical abilities. Through these activities, I have learned that beyond coding skills, achieving shared goals together with teammates is invaluable.

I have demonstrated my capabilities through diverse projects. Developing a Library Seat Reservation Management System helped me build database design and backend development skills, while projects such as an AI Omok Game and an 8-Puzzle solver improved my ability to optimize algorithms and tackle complex problems. By developing the Cookie Run client and server using TCP socket programming, I also gained a deeper understanding of network communication. I am confident these experiences will serve as a strong foundation for overcoming technical challenges in the financial IT field.

Building on these skills and experiences, I aim to deliver greater value to users and grow into a developer who brings positive impact to society. I look forward to opportunities to create the future together with those who believe in my potential.
